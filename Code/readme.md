# Trying mypy on the Python sources

I recommend playing with types and **mypy** using Python 3.6 

1. Install Python 3.6 (or later) (should be available in your package manager of choice)
2. Install [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)
3. Run `mypy file.py`
4. Play around with the types! Define some functions!

# Trying scala on an interactive shell

This small example should work in any recent version of Scala

1. Install Scala (should be available in your package manager of choice)
2. Run `scala` to open the interactive interpreter
3. Load it by issuing the command `:load traits.scala`
4. Play around!
